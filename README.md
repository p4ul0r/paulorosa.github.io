profile@paulo rosa. i am a events production trainer and experienced events producer. in my +20 years as an events producer, i helped produce events in multiple areas
and with a large emphasis in the automotive industry, the surf industry and the music shows / concerts industry.
In a recent pass, i realized the industry was not lacking the human resources to produce events, but lacking the know how in a multitude of situations common to the 
day-to-day of an events producer, so i decided to put the effort in administering this courses to help mantain a high level of quality in the events produced by my "educaties", specially in my ares of expertise.
Found my bio and info online and i hope you enjoy the experience
